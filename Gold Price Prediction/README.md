# ðŸª™ Gold Price Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict gold prices based on historical financial data. It applies data preprocessing, correlation analysis, and model training to make accurate predictions using a Random Forest Regressor.

 # ðŸ“Š Project Highlights
- Analyzed historical gold price data and handled missing values.
- Explored feature relationships using correlation heatmaps and visualizations.
- Applied a **Random Forest Regressor** for predicting future gold prices.
- Evaluated model performance and visualized predictions.

# ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

# ðŸ“˜Dataset : Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/gold-price-prediction-dataset)
